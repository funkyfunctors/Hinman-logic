Hi, here I would be uploading proofs of problems from fundamentals of mathematical logic Book by Peter G. Hinman (CRC press). I would only be doing selected exercises because lot of them are brutal ;(

Considered to be the bible of logic by many, this introductory graduate text covers modern mathematical logic from propositional, first-order and infinitary logic and GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems to extensive introductions to set theory, model theory and recursion (computability) theory.
